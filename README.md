# CMPT 276: Product Document

## introduction

what is the project about?
## Project Organization

### Communication Tools
- Slack

### Software Repository
- Git and [Github](https://github.com/KSSidhu/CMPT276)

### Testing and Quality Assurance Tools
- Running previously created games
- Using available software to test emulator and Visualizer
- Jest is possible automated testing tool

### Software Methodology
Roles:
- Emulator: James Young, Kirat Sidhu
- Visualizer: James Young, Kirat Sidhu
- Plugin: Chamodi
- Game 1: Adam
- Game 2: Aloshius

Primarily team members will be testing their own work
However, when problems arise the creators of said product must return, fix, and retest

|Product to be Tested   |Testers                 |
|  ----                 | ------                 |
|Emulator and Visualizer| Kirat and James        |
|Chip8 Tool             | Chamodi and Aloshius   |
|Games                  | Adam, Aloshius, Chamodi|

### risk analysis

key risks, and how they will be dealt with
### hardware and software requirements

hardware and software that is needed, both for development and after development during production
### work breakdown

Release 1:
<ol>
  <li>Research Emulator and Visualizer Design
  <li>Research automated testing
  <li>Select Coding Language and Libraries
  <li>Design Emulator and Visualizer, key focus on emulator
  <li>James and Kirat Implement Design
  <li>Primary testing method is to run small available software to see if compatible with emulator
</ol>

Release 2:
<ol>
  <li>If required, research more on Visualizer
  <li>Research possible useful Chip8 tools, currently considering Plugin for Sublime
  <li>Design Visualizer, and Select Chip8 Tool to build, depending on what's completed may also select Games
  <li>James and Kirat Implement design of Visualizer
  <li>Chamodi and Aloshius begin implementation of Chip8 tool
  <li>Test visualizer with available games and software, and run with created Emulator
  <li>Test tool with Sublime and recreate Emulator to test if runs accordingly
</ol>

Release 3:
<ol>
  <li>Select both games if haven't already
  <li>Research possible implementations
  <li>Adam, Chamodi and Aloshius work on two games
  <li>James and Kirat, if finished with Emulator and Visualizer, can aid any members
  <li>Test games by running on available emulators and visualizers
  <li>Also test on team's visualizer and emulator
  <li>If problems arise with team's visualizer and emulator, Kirat and James will return to them to improve
</ol>

Release 4:
  <ol>
  <li>Allocate members to work on games, or improve previous releases if needed
  <li>Members not working on any coding parts of the project will finalize the presentation
  <li>Emulator and Visualizer should be fully completed at this point, with no bugs
  <li>Game designers should be able to use them freely at this point
  <li>Designers will test games on our own emulators and visualizers along with publicly available ones
  </ol>
